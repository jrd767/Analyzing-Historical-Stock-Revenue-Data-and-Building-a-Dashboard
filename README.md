# üìã Project Overview

For this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm that helps customers invest in stocks. My job is to extract financial data such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. The stocks we will work with include Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

# üìâ Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard provides a clear view of key performance indicators. In this project, I analyze data sets and extract important indicators which are then visualized on dashboards. Prompts and interactive displays are used to support learning in accessing and displaying data using Plotly. This project leverages Skills Network Labs for hands-on learning and IBM Watson Studio for collaboration.

# üìà Stock Shares

A stock (or equity) represents ownership in a company. Owning shares means you own a fraction of the corporation, entitling you to a proportion of its assets and profits. Stock prices fluctuate based on many factors, and they are updated continuously during trading sessions. In this project, I use the yfinance API to obtain stock ticker data and extract key financial information.

## üìÑ Summary

This project demonstrates foundational Python skills for working with data. The goal is to develop a dashboard using Python to analyze and compare historical stock price data with revenue data.
